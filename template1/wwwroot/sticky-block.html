        <h1 class="title">King Cobra</h1>
        <p>
          The king cobra was described and drawn by the Danish naturalist
          Theodore Edward Cantor in 1836, who gave it the scientific name
          Hamadryas hannah. Cantor had three specimens from the Sundarbans and
          one caught in the vicinity of Kolkata. It was subordinated to the
          genus Ophiophagus by Albert Günther in 1864.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ophiophagus hannah belongs to the monotypic genus Ophiophagus in the
          family Elapidae, while most other cobras are members of the genus
          Naja. They can be distinguished from other cobras by size and hood.
          King cobras are generally larger than other cobras, and the stripe on
          the neck is a chevron instead of a double or single eye shape that may
          be seen in most of the other Asian cobras. Moreover, the hood of the
          king cobra is narrower and longer. A key to identification, clearly
          visible on the head, is the presence of a pair of large scales known
          as occipitals, located at the back of the top of the head. These are
          behind the usual "nine-plate" arrangement typical of colubrids and
          elapids, and are unique to the king cobra.
        </p>
        <p class="tallScreenText">
          The skin of king cobra is dark olive or brown with black bands and
          white or yellow crossbands. The head is black with two crossbars near
          the snout and two behind the eyes. Adult king cobras are 3.18 to 4 m
          (10.4 to 13.1 ft) long. The longest known individual measured 5.85 m
          (19.2 ft). Its belly is cream or pale yellow. It has 17 to 19 rows of
          smooth scales. Ventral scales are uniformly oval shaped. Dorsal scales
          are placed in an oblique arrangement. Males have 235 to 250 ventral
          scales, while females have 239 to 265. The subcaudal scales are single
          or paired in each row, numbering 83 to 96 in males and 77 to 98 in
          females.
        </p>
        <p class="tallScreenText">
          Juveniles are shiny black with narrow yellow bands (can be mistaken
          for a banded krait, but readily identified with its expandable hood).
          The head of a mature snake can be quite massive and bulky in
          appearance, though like all snakes, it can expand its jaws to swallow
          large prey items. It has proteroglyph dentition, meaning it has two
          short, fixed fangs in the front of the mouth, which channel venom into
          the prey like hypodermic needles. The average lifespan of a wild king
          cobra is about 20 years.

        <h1 class="title">Swan</h1>
        <p>
          Swans are birds of the family Anatidae within the genus Cygnus. The
          swans' close relatives include the geese and ducks. Swans are grouped
          with the closely related geese in the subfamily Anserinae where they
          form the tribe Cygnini. Sometimes, they are considered a distinct
          subfamily, Cygninae. There are six or seven living (and one extinct)
          species of swan in the genus Cygnus; in addition, there is another
          species known as the coscoroba swan, although this species is no
          longer considered one of the true swans. Swans usually mate for life,
          although “divorce” sometimes occurs, particularly following nesting
          failure, and if a mate dies, the remaining swan will take up with
          another. The number of eggs in each clutch ranges from three to eight.
